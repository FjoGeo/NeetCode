# Arrays & Hashing


## 217. Contains Duplicate
- Solution 1: Two loops, enumerate through the list and compare
- Solution 2: Sort and compare adjustant members
- __Solution 3__: Create a hashset, and check if the value exists in the hashset


## 242. Valid Anagram
- Solution 1: Sort both arrays check if they are similar (use sorted(string))
- __Solution 2__: First check length, then create a hashmap for each input and compare them


## 1. Two Sum
- Solution 1: Bruteforce -> two loops
- __Solution 2__: Create a hashset with value:index, iterate through array adn calculate difference between value and target, search if difference is in hashset already, if yes return current index and index of difference
